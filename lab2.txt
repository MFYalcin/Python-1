Exploring Variables

The exercises must be done in Python Tutor (pythontutor.com).
Python Tutor is a great tool for VISUALIZING the execution of code and to understand
the use of memory by a computer program.  Use the default SETTINGS:
  - Hide Exited Frames
  - Inline Primitives and try to nest objects
  - Draw Pointers as Arrows

Note: Python Tutor is a tool for LEARNING.  Wing 101 is a tool for writing real programs.
They are both great, but have different purposes and strengths.

============

Exercise 1:  To convert a temperature measured on the Celsius scale to the 
equivalent Fahrenheit temperature, we multiply the Celsius temperature by 9/5, then add 32. 
For example, 20.0 degrees Celsius is equivalent to 68.0 degrees Fahrenheit.

In Python Tutor's editor window:
1. Type one assignment statement that creates a new variable named degrees_c and binds it to 20.0. 
2. Type one assignment statement that converts the temperature bound to degrees_c to the 
equivalent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. This temperature should be bound to a 
new variable named degrees_f.

Click the Visualize Execution button. Execute the code, one statement at a time. 
Observe the memory diagram as the code is executed, step-by-step. Verify that your code
produces a result of 68.0 degrees Farenheit.

When does variable degrees_c appear in the diagram?  
- 'degrees_c' appears after the execution of assignment of degrees_c = 20.0

What is the name of the frame containing degrees_c?  
- Global frame, degrees_c is an assigned variable.

When does variable degrees_f appear in the diagram?
- It is seen after the execution of assigned degrees_c as 68.0 since the variable of degrees_f is ((9/5)*degrees_c + 32).

===========

Exercise 2: In some countries, a vehicle's fuel efficiency is measured in miles per gallon. 
In other countries, the efficiency is measured in litres per 100 km. 
For example, 32 miles per Imperial gallon is equivalent to approximately 8.83 litres per 100 km.

You're going to write Python statements that convert miles per gallon to litres per 100 km. 
One Imperial gallon is equal to approximately 4.54609 litres. 
One mile is equal to approximately 1.60934 km. 

In Python Tutor's editor window:
1. Type one assignment statement that creates a new variable named mpg and 
binds it to the value 32 (which represents 32 miles per gallon).
2. Type two assignment statements that create new constants named LITRES_PER_GALLON and 
KMS_PER_MILE and binds them to the values 4.54609 and 1.60934, respectively. 
(Note that the names of constant values in Python are, by convention, written in uppercase.)
3. Type one assignment statement that converts the mileage bound to mpg to the equivalent fuel 
consumption, measured in litres per 100 km. This value should be bound to a variable named 
fuel_consumption.

Click the Visualize Execution button. Execute the code, one statement at a time. 
Observe the memory diagram as the code is executed, step-by-step. Verify that your code
produces a result of 8.83 litres per 100 km.

When do the variables appear in the diagram?
- The given constants as mgp(may change), LITRES_PER_GALLON, KMS_PER_MILE and fuel_consumption appear in order, below the Global Frame
What are the types and values of the objects?
- 'mpg' is 32 and integer, LITRES_PER_GALLON is 4.54609 and float, KMS_PER_MILE is 1.60934 and float, flue_consumption is 8.8276 and float.

-mpg = 32
LITRES_PER_GALLON = 4.54609
KMS_PER_MILE = 1.60934
fuel_consumption = 100/(mpg*KMS_PER_MILE)*LITRES_PER_GALLON
===========

Exercise 3: Consider these assignment statements:
a = 8			# 1
b = 2			# 2
c = a * b		# 3
d = b			# 4
a = 2			# 5
b = 3			# 6

First, test your visualization skills by executing the given statements in your head,
without using the Python shell or PyTutor to assist you.

- Predict the value that will be bound to c AFTER Line 4 is executed: 
- 2

- Predict the value that will be bound to d AFTER Line 6 is executed: 
- 3

Confirm your answers by entering these statements in Python tutor and executing
the code one statement at a time.
- 
8  #1 
2  #2
16 #3
2  #4 
2  #5
3  #6

Concluding Question: This set of statements is an experiment. What question is the
experiment trying to answer? (i.e. What is proven by this exercise?)
- This exercise is meant to show that every frame binds first to an object and then they might be resigned to another object, therefore the frame's statement is changed. 
The order of the statements have to be looked carefully at.


===========
Exercise 4: Explore augmented operators. 

In Python Tutor's editor window, enter the following and execute one statement at a time.

x = 3
x *= x - x

Concluding Question: Write a short step-by-step explanation of how Python evaluates the
second statement. 
- First, x is signed to value 3 and the second step, what happens is that augmented operator '*=' is used and ' x - x ' is counted as 0,
 therefore 'x' is now assigned to 0 since x*0 = 0
